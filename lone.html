<div id="section0"><p>Good morning. Let's basketball.

    The Clippers have hired Lee Jenkins as the team's new executive director of research and identity. And here we thought kids from Vanderbilt couldn't make it in the league ...
     
    Jenkins, of course, is a Sports Illustrated legend (still just 40 years old!) and the sport's pre-eminent profile writer. It's not unprecedented to go from writing (Jenkins' old SI colleague Luke Winn works for the Raptors), though it is pretty rare.
     
    Even more, the usual path from journalism to working for a team is through analytics, as happened with John Hollinger, SB Nation alum Sebastian Pruiti, Kevin Pelton (for a spell), Seth Partnow, and legendary Dean Oliver (and others I'm unintentionally forgetting). Jenkins is different -- his strength is in prose, in reportage, in relationships. (Did I mention prose? Dude is a writer's writer.) The Clippers are richer for this, and frankly, our insight into the NBA's biggest stars and personalities is poorer.
     
    That said, we all know this is just a ruse under which Lee will orchestrate the relocation of the Clippers back to his beloved San Diego. Three-dimensional chess.
    
    </p><p>Wait of Wade 


        Dwyane Wade announced on Monday that he will play one more season in the NBA. The Heat will love to have him! Let's hope he can help Miami make another playoff push in a better-than-you-think Eastern Conference.
         
        What's so striking about Wade now is that he looks his age while his friend and contemporary LeBron James looks like a kid. Wade is three years older (despite being in the same draft class) and had a style of play more reliant on athleticism and conducive to injury.
         
        But Wade at his peak in the late Aughts and early '10s? Few were more divine. Can't wait to enjoy the season-long farewell tour.
